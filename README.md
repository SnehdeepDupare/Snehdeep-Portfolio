Hey there! Welcome to my Portfolio Repository, this repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects and skills.

## About Me

Hi, Snehdeep here! I am a Full Stack Developer that enjoys to paint the internet canvas with my Projects. I am a curious individual and likes to explore and learn new technologies and challenge myself to improve my coding skills. You can visit my portfolio at [snehdeepdupare.in](https://snehdeepdupare.in) to know more about me.

## Tech Stack

- **Next JS 13:** Next.js 13 serves as the foundation for my portfolio, enabling lightning-fast web applications with its advanced server-side rendering capabilities.

- **Sanity CMS:** I utilize Sanity CMS to easily manage and update my portfolio's content, ensuring it remains fresh and engaging. Sanity is a headless CMS that simplifies content management.

- **Typescript:** I rely on TypeScript to enhance code quality and ensure type safety, making my codebase more maintainable and resilient while reducing the occurrence of bugs and streamlining development.

- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid UI development, I leverage the power of Tailwind CSS, which allows me to create responsive, visually stunning, and highly customizable user interfaces.

- **Framer Motion:** To immerse visitors in captivating animations and interactions, I use Framer Motion, enabling the creation of fluid and engaging UI elements that enhance the overall user experience.
